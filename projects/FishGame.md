Fish Game was a project my group and I did for ICS 211. The premise of the game is that you play against a partner, and the goal is to earn the most points.
Each fish is worth a different amount, and players take turns trying to catch one. The type of fish you catch is random, so it is not a game of skill. 
There are also twists and turns, including a black market where you can potentially sell your fish for more points, even if you have exceeded the limit 
of fish you are allowed to keep. However, if the park rangers catch you with more fish than allowed, they will confiscate all your fish and deduct some of your points.
You must go through a full year of fishing (12 turns, one for each month) to see who is the champion at the end.
